# A Step-by-Step Guide to Build a Llama 2 on Azure powered Teams Chat Bot with built-in Azure AI Content Safety #

The Llama-2-7b-chat model on Azure powered chat bot, utilizing advanced language models, brings a range of capabilities to enhance communication and collaboration within Microsoft Teams. With its natural language processing abilities, Llama 2 chat models can understand and respond to user queries and requests, providing relevant information and assistance.

By integrating Llama 2 chat models with Microsoft Teams, users can easily access the chat bot directly from their Teams interface. This means they can engage with LLM without leaving the Teams platform, saving time and effort. They can ask questions, seek guidance, or request information, and Llama will provide prompt and accurate responses, helping to streamline workflows and improve productivity.

Additionally, the integration with Azure AI Content Safety ensures that conversations  remain secure and free from inappropriate or harmful content. This powerful combination ensures that users can communicate and collaborate with peace of mind, knowing that the Azure AI content safety is actively monitoring and filtering any potentially harmful or offensive content.

Overall, the integration of Llama-2-7b-chat model on Azure with Teams, along with the inclusion of Azure AI Content Safety, creates a comprehensive solution that not only enhances productivity and collaboration but also prioritizes user safety and security. This makes it an ideal choice for businesses looking for efficient and secure communication tools to support their teams' workflows.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with Azure Machine Learning resource
- Deploying Llama 2 models require GPU compute of V100 / A100 SKUs. You can view and request AzureML compute quota [here](https://ml.azure.com/quota).
- Install Bot Composer [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/composer/install-composer?tabs=windows).
- Teams for work or school , You can download from [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2187327&Lmsrc=groupChatMarketingPageWeb&Cmpid=directDownloadWin64&clcid=0x409&culture=en-us&country=us)

## Things to Note 

- The bot maintains conversation history to be passed to the model and ensures conversation history is maintained only for pre-configured number of conversation turns to prevent hitting token limits in its memory, the state management in the bot is a sample and may not be suited for Production workloads 

- Please note that this tutorial is intended for explorative and illustrative purposes only. It is meant to inspire ideas and should not be taken as prescriptive advice. Any implementation of the techniques described in this tutorial as part of your application should be thoroughly validated and evaluated to ensure accuracy, validity, compatibility with your specific use case and technical environment.

- Please be aware that the prompt instructions shown are not intended to be a correct and complete representation of the prompts that should be used with your applications in production. They are provided for informational purposes only and may not be suitable for all use cases. It is important to carefully consider your specific requirements and design appropriate prompts that meet your users' needs and expectations.

- While LLMs have tremendous potential across many industries and use cases, it is essential to ensure that they are built in a safe and responsible manner. This includes taking steps to mitigate potential risks and ensure that the model will not cause harm to users or result in reputational damage to organizations. It is important to carefully consider the ethical implications of LLMs and to develop appropriate safeguards to protect against potential harms.

## Technical Flow

- Azure Bot's Teams channel is enabled and deployed in Teams app. 
  
- The Teams channel Bot makes HTTP Post requests with user prompt history to the Azure Machine learning real-time inference endpoints  
  
- Azure Machine learning real-time inference endpoints hosts the Llama-2-7b-chat model with built in Azure AI Content Safety monitoring
  
- The User prompts are monitored , validated and filtered by  Azure AI Content Safety resource
  
- Safe Prompts are sent to Llama-2-7b-chat model and response from Llama-2-7b-chat model is also monitored and validated by the Azure AI Content Safety resource
  
- Safe Responses are sent back to Azure Bot via the Azure Machine learning real-time inference endpoints

## Steps

*As noted in the Prerequisites sections Deploying Llama 2 models requires GPU compute of V100 / A100 SKUs , Please ensure you have quota available for v100 or A100*

**How to work with the Llama-2-7b-chat deployment models**

*Please be aware that the prompt instructions shown are not intended to be a correct and complete representation of the prompts that should be used with your applications in production. They are provided for informational purposes only and may not be suitable for all use cases. It is important to carefully consider your specific requirements and design appropriate prompts that meet your users' needs and expectations.*

- Below is the sample chat history that must be sent to the Llama-2-7b-chat model , In this tutorial we will see an sample approach to create this Json in Bot composer (approach not production scale) , as see below the user question followed by model answers needs to be maintained and passed back to model , the model understands context based on the chat history  
             
- The system role/message is optional, but it's recommended to at least include a basic one to get the best results.

              }
             }
           }

- If the conversation history is too long we would exceed the maximum token limit and would result in errors , In the bot composer we would remove the oldest User question and assitant answers whenever a configured threshold is reached , this would prevent us from hitting the token limit . After removing the oldest question and answers the above Json would look like below

**Create an Azure Bot and make HTTP Post requests to real-time inference endpoint that hosts Llama-2-7b-chat model with built in Azure AI Content Safety**

- Open Bot Framework Composer , and create an Empty Bot and name it according to your needs and create the bot

    <img width="985" alt="image" src="https://github.com/mahes-a/StagingBuild/assets/120069348/f37bd7be-9831-4f84-a574-2d1d7bc9f969">

- From the bot project (not the root solution) add a trigger and add message received activity  , this can be optional and entire bot can be designed in the "Unknown Intent" trigger too

        "AML_Llama_Inference_Url": "",
        "AML_Llama_Inference_Key": "",

  *Please note the tutorial uses conversation memory scope throught the composer for simplicity and brevity , for your production use case ,use the most apt memory scope , refer [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/composer/concept-memory?tabs=v2x) for memory scopes and their usage , we build a json using string manipulations and array for simplicity and brevity and we donot use any custom components in this tutorial*

- First step lets Create a Array property to hold user question and answers , coalesce to prevent errors on first time load

     ``` conversation.context.chathistory = =coalesce(conversation.context.chathistory, [])```

    <img width="341" alt="image" src="https://github.com/mahes-a/StagingBuild/assets/120069348/18159c3a-d5b9-4875-8928-20d66e933475">
    
- Add the logic to remove the  oldest two messages in the chathistory array if the convesration history array contains more elements than our configured message count , this would prevent token limit errors , refer to section above to find details , this is done in create a condition -> if/else 

            =count(conversation.context.chathistory) > settings.api.Past_Message_Count 
             conversation.context.chathistory
             =subArray(conversation.context.chathistory, 2, count(conversation.context.chathistory))

- Add  set properties  to clean prompts  and build the  string in format of "role": "user", "content": "user prompt" , this is our first setp in building the json required

          conversation.context.currquestmp
          =replace(replace(replace(replace(turn.activity.text, ' \ ', '\\'), '"', '\"'), ' ', '\r'), ' ', '\n')

          conversation.context.currques
          =concat(' {"role": "user","content":  "', trim(conversation.context.currquestmp), '" }')

              conversation.context.chathistory

              =concat(' {"role": "assistant","content":  "', trim(replace(replace(replace(replace(conversation.context.api_response.content.output, ' \ ', '\\'), '"', '\"'), ' ', '\r'), ' ', '\n')), '" }')
